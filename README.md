## Overview
Explores the basics of using Apple's on-device Intelligence Foundation Model, including:<br><br>
    - Checking the availability of Apple Intelligence on a device<br>
    - Configuring basic model parameters<br>
    - Prompting the foundation model<br>
    - Processing streaming output<br>

## Quick Start

‚ö°Ô∏è To get started, assuming a ~/MyProjects project folder:

<pre>
1) Clone apple-afm-hello to ~/MyProjects

2) Use XCode to build ~/MyProjects/apple-afm-hello

3) Run & enter a question in the prompt field, then select ‚èµ
</pre>

## Before We Start

- Apple's approach to on-device large language models focuses on specific tasks and excels at processing natural 
language, rather than providing general world knowledge or advanced reasoning capabilities typically associated
with larger, cloud-based LLMs.

- To address the limitations, developers should use @Generable types to force structure to the output of the LLM,
and further refine output with tool calling using external data sources or services within an app.

- For more complex tasks requiring greater computational capacity or access to a wider range of knowledge, Apple
offers Private Cloud Compute, which uses larger, server-based models running on Apple silicon while maintaining
user privacy guarantees.

- Requires macOS Tahoe 26+

- Requires building with XCode 26+
